## ‚ú® Features

1. **Data Collection**

   - Gathered from the [SMS Spam Collection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) on Kaggle, comprising over 5,500 labeled SMS messages.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

   - Removal of null and duplicate values.
   - Label encoding of the "type" column.
   - Text processing:
     - Tokenization
     - Removal of special characters, stop words, and punctuation
     - Stemming
     - Conversion to lowercase

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Insights include:
     - Character, word, and sentence counts.
     - Correlation analysis.
   - Visualizations:
     - Bar and pie charts
     - Heatmaps
     - Word clouds for spam and non-spam messages
     - Frequent word analysis for spam messages

4. **Model Building and Selection**

   - Tested classifiers: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Extra Trees Classifier, and SVC.
   - Achieved 100% precision with the best-performing model.

5. **Web Deployment**
   - Deployed via Streamlit with a clean, user-friendly interface.
   - Users can input an SMS message and receive predictions instantly.
